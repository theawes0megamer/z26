Zero 2 Sixty

Zero 2 Sixty is a project that I have been developing that uses any computer (I use a Raspberry Pi) and a GPS (right now communicates via serial /dev/ttyS0)
It is meant to measure 0-60 times of vehicles. It uses a 10hz GPS (10 refreshes a second) and I will soon be implementing a 50hz accelerometer to better track the launch and start the timer then to get more accurate times.

This project is very WIP, and is my first python program.
