GPSD INSTRUCTIONS FOR SERIAL INTERFACING

RASPIAN:

Remove 'console=serial0,115200' from /boot/cmdline.txt 

run 'stty -F /dev/ttyS0 speed 115200' (sets baud rate to GPS, may vary depending on what GPS module you have)
If it says something about it in use, you can stop GPSD by running 'sudo service gpsd stop'

then you can run 'gpsd -s 115200 /dev/ttyS0'
